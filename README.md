# pythonSearch
My first exploration with Python. This program opens up a web browser to the search engine of your choice and searches for whatever input you give it.

To run:

**Clone this repository**

**cd into repository**

**run search.py in the command line**

    python3 search.py

**enjoy your cat pictures or dank memes**
